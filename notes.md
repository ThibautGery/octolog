Notes on this project


## Serverless
 * 1/2 hour to setup project, stupid error
 * must package with dependencies (heavy package)
 * integration with AWS CF is a pleasure

## AWS:
 * integration API Gateway and lambda, no so pleasant (path parameter + return code)
 * DynamoDB is not as easy as mongo to setup, must explicitly give a schema
 * publish documentation on API Gateway ==> failure
